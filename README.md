github-starred-catalog
======================

This is a simple tool to make a catalog of your starred projects on github.
I know that github already let you do this but what the heck, I wanted to learn Go!

Set up the environment
----------------------

First at all, intall Go (http://golang.org/doc/install)

Then, download the dependencies:

```
    go get "github.com/google/go-github/github"
    go get "github.com/wsxiaoys/terminal"
```

Finally, run the app

```
    go run gh-catalog.go
```

Done!
